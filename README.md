## Encode arbitrary file as a png

Let's say you want to share something. Let's also say that thing you want to share is a file type that is "not allowed" for one reason or another. However, sharing images is ok.

### fpng

fpng \[en|de\]codes an aribtrary file to png format. This means the file created by encode will be a .png file. It won't be pretty. It will be a square. But when you decode it, it will be a perfect lossless match to the original input file.
